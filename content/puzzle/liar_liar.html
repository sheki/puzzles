--- 
name : Liar Liar
---
As a newbie on a particular internet discussion board, you notice a distinct trend among its veteran members; everyone seems to be either unfailingly honest or compulsively deceptive. You decide to try to identify the members of the two groups, starting with the assumption that every senior member either never lies or never tells the truth. You compile as much data as possible, asking each person for a list of which people are liars. Since the people you are asking have been around on the board for a long time, you may assume that they have perfect knowledge of who is trustworthy and who is not. Each person will respond with a list of people that they accuse of being liars. Everyone on the board can see that you are a tremendous n00b, so they will grudgingly give you only partial lists of who the liars are. Of course these lists are not to be taken at face value because of all the lying going on.
