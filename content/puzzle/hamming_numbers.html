title: Hamming Numbers 
---

Hamming Numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 and 5. They are named after [Richard Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming).
They became famous after [Edsger Dijkstra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra) posed the question of how to efficiently enumerate them in numeric order.

So the question here is how can you efficiently generate Hamming Numbers in increasing order.
